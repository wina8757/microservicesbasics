# microservicesbasics by Jessen Winardinata

### This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.2 with node version 8.9.4 and using back end such as Spring Boot to replace the gify key by using a microservices to handle the api management

### This project are using 4 API which are gettyImages, giphy, talaikis, pixabay API in order to fullfill the requirement of the project and for learning how to use API with the Angular CLI

### The software engineering principles that we are using are the design patern, we are kinda learning how to use design patern in this homework, such as we divided components into user and about.

### The problem that I'm facing are how to implements API into Angular CLI and learning the new syntax for the Angular CLI. Besides that, I'm facing an error when I run the prgram from heroku especially when we go to the about. If we run it 2 times it gives me error "Cannot GET /about" but then when I run it in c9. It totally runs perfectly fine without any errors. Another problem that I face is pretty hard to setup the Spring Boot, Apache, and Java environments on Mac. I spend a lot of hours only to figure it out. Luckily I've been helped by the TA to overcome this problem.

### I want to improve on how the Angular works and have more experience in setting up the Angular. Besides that, I want to improve in the upcoming hw or assignment or near the future about using back end such as microservices to support the front end.
